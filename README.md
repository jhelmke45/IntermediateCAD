## Pull_Copter

### Description

In this assignment, we collaborated with a partner to make a 3D printable pull copter toy. My partner was [Robel](https://github.com/rgabramedhin93).

### 4.1 - Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!

Making the Ring and Spinner

### Evidence

### Reflection

This assignment wasn't too hard, but was a good reintroduction to CAD. This part made good use of the front plane to create the ring with the center floating. 

### 4.2 - Teamwork! - Key and Prop

Making the Key and Prop

### Evidence

### Reflection

This part was definitely more interesting to make. It makes use of a linear pattern for all of the notches in the key, and used the print gap variable to determine the size, and to allow it to be modified later if need be. The mate connecter in the part studio was also a thoughtful hint at the next step.

### 4.3 - Teamwork! - Assembling the launcher

Assembling the full pull coptor

### Evidence

### Reflection

It's always nice to be it all together and see how everything fits! It's even more satisfying when you're able to animate everything with a rack and pinion mate, and activate a section view to see those gears meshing perfectly.

### 4.4 - Teamwork! - Branching & Merging

Messing with versions and branching

### Evidence

### Reflection

This was a good introduction to versions, branching, and merging, all things I had never done before. They have very helpful uses though, as there's no better feeling than being able to break your parts in whatever funny way you want and then simply reverting back to a better functioning design. 

## Swing_Arm

### Description

This assignment was meant to mimic something we might see on the Onshape certification exam. We were given drawings for a part, and then had to recreate it as an actual object in CAD.

### Evidence

_My complete part_

### Reflection

This was a challenge for me, but once I got down the concepts it was alright, albeit some minor errors which took some tracking down. I definitely feel like I learned from this though, especially with constraining and variables. Once you've got everything set up properly it's a matter of typing in numbers, so it's worth the time of making sure everything is constrained properly. 

## Multi-Part_Studio

### Description

In this assignment, we again had to create a finished product in Onshape based off of drawings given to us. This time, we were given a handful of parts to recreate in a single part studio to create a pump design.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This one went a lot smoother for me than the last model we made from drawings. It might be because there were more straightforward dimensions given, but I also felt a lot more comfortable generally taking what was in the drawings and putting it into the model. I must have learned something about constraining and depencies though, because everything went smoothly when I changed some of the values in the later questions.

## Assembly_Practice

### Description

In this assignment, I used the parts and guide made by Onshape to properly assembly a toggle clamp. 

### Evidence

_A picture of the completed assembly, and a GIF showing the parts moving properly together_

### Reflection

This assembly wasn't too hard, especially with instructions from Onshape if you get stuck. The most notable thing was having to create an explicit mate connecter in order to properly connect some of the parts, which wasn't something I'd had to do before, but it was still pretty simple and didn't take long to figure out. Other than that all I really had to do was make sure everything was mated correctly, and it's always satisfying to see all of the parts working together.

## Onshape_Certification

### Description

This section is mainly a reflection on the preparation and test in which I became a certified Onshape associate.

### Certificate

_Above is a screenshot of the certificate, which can be viewed in pdf form [here](https://ti-user-certificates.s3.amazonaws.com/6e557ed6-d03d-4c48-9492-4d18d145d7a1/734484d1-990e-4a36-ae5d-4c4d29ef5674-jack-helmke-a62a2539-f226-4519-9fda-0b1be1549770-certificate.pdf).

### Reflection

I am generally more of a coder than a CAD designer, but I still felt pretty prepared for the certification test. We did a good amount of preparation in the weeks before the test, practicing replicating parts that were very similar to those on the actual test, so I had a good idea of what to expect. The main thing that threw me off on the test was the time. I went into the test expecting lots of time pressure, but I ended up having plenty of extra time. While this was ultimately good, I was really stressed at the beginning because of how the time crunch had been emphasized to me, which caused me to make some poor design choices or unnecessarily cut corners to try and estimate answers. It ended up being fine because I could go back and check my work, and my rushing certainly helped me have extra time at the end, but if I were to go back and do it again I would definitely take my time more in the design section and strive for accuracy rather than rushing. Other than that, the test went pretty smoothly, and I only missed a few questions over the course of the entire test, so I was very happy with how I did.
