## Pull_Copter

### Description

In this assignment, we collaborated with a partner to make a 3D printable pull copter toy. My partner was [Robel](https://github.com/rgabramedhin93).

### 4.1 - Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!

Making the Ring and Spinner

### Evidence

### Reflection

This assignment wasn't too hard, but was a good reintroduction to CAD. This part made good use of the front plane to create the ring with the center floating. 

### 4.2 - Teamwork! - Key and Prop

Making the Key and Prop

### Evidence

### Reflection

This part was definitely more interesting to make. It makes use of a linear pattern for all of the notches in the key, and used the print gap variable to determine the size, and to allow it to be modified later if need be. The mate connecter in the part studio was also a thoughtful hint at the next step.

### 4.3 - Teamwork! - Assembling the launcher

Assembling the full pull coptor

### Evidence

### Reflection

It's always nice to be it all together and see how everything fits! It's even more satisfying when you're able to animate everything with a rack and pinion mate, and activate a section view to see those gears meshing perfectly.

### 4.4 - Teamwork! - Branching & Merging

Messing with versions and branching

### Evidence

_An example of a basic edit I made to the prop_

### Reflection

This was a good introduction to versions, branching, and merging, all things I had never done before. They have very helpful uses though, as there's no better feeling than being able to break your parts in whatever funny way you want and then simply reverting back to a better functioning design. 

## Swing_Arm

### Description

This assignment was meant to mimic something we might see on the Onshape certification exam. We were given drawings for a part, and then had to recreate it as an actual object in CAD.

### Evidence

_My complete part_

### Reflection

This was a challenge for me, but once I got down the concepts it was alright, albeit some minor errors which took some tracking down. I definitely feel like I learned from this though, especially with constraining and variables. Once you've got everything set up properly it's a matter of typing in numbers, so it's worth the time of making sure everything is constrained properly. 

## Multi-Part_Studio

### Description

In this assignment, we again had to create a finished product in Onshape based off of drawings given to us. This time, we were given a handful of parts to recreate in a single part studio to create a pump design.

### Evidence

_My final design, after changes made in other questions_

### Reflection

This one went a lot smoother for me than the last model we made from drawings. It might be because there were more straightforward dimensions given, but I also felt a lot more comfortable generally taking what was in the drawings and putting it into the model. I must have learned something about constraining and depencies though, because everything went smoothly when I changed some of the values in the later questions.
